        <h1>What it sounds like</h1>
        <h3>by Huntrix</h3>
        <p>Nothing but the truth now <br>
        Nothing but the proof of what I am<br>
        The worst of what I came from, <br>
        patterns I'm ashamed of <br>
        Things that even I don't understand <br>
        I tried to fix it, I tried to fight it <br>
        My head was twisted, my heart divided <br>
        My lies all collided <br>
        I don't know why I didn't trust you <br>
         to be on my side <br> 

    </p>
    <p><strong>Chorus</strong> <br>
    I broke into a million pieces, and I can't go back <br>
But now I'm seeing all the beauty in the broken glass <br>
The scars are part of me, <br>
darkness and harmony <br>
My voice without the lies <br>
this is what it sounds like</p>
